	<p><strong>i)	Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME)</strong><br />
Candidates should posses passes at credit level in senior  secondary certificate final year examination or GCE “O”  level in five subjects including English Language, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and any other science subject at not more than two sittings. In addition to this the applicant should meet the necessary UME cut off point.

    </p>
    <p>
<strong>ii)	Direct Entry</strong><br>

For direct entry into 200 level, candidates must have passes in Mathematics and Physics at GCE “A” level or its equivalent. ND and HND with a minimum of Upper credit pass from any NBTE accredited Polytechnic are eligible for admission. Candidates must also meet the “O” level requirement of five credits.</p>

<p><strong>iii)	Admission through Remedial Programme</strong><br>

</p>

<p><strong>*Degree Nomenclature</strong><br>

The Programme runs the Bachelor of Engineering. (B. Eng.) degree programme in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
</p>
<p><strong>*Duration of Programme</strong><br>

The Bachelor of Engineering (B. Eng.) programme in Electrical and Electronics Engineering normally last for five (5) years (100 to 500 Levels). However, direct entry candidates spend four (4) years. The programme is structured in such a way that all Engineering students offer the same basic courses at 100 and 200 Levels in order to prepare them for the Engineering profession. The 300 to 500 Level courses are more detailed and focused towards professional training in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
